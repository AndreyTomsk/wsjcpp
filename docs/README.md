(in a progress...)

Yet one... 'Source Package Manager For C++' for create a little microservices based on dockerfile using c++

## Mission

You can get the source code as quickly as possible and build your microservice or server based on c++

## Why?

I think this: 

1. On c++ you can get a little size of program
2. On C++ you can more for optimization
3. Docker image must be a little size and easy
4. Cryptography usually on c++
5. Big a story of projects on c++
6. etc.

## Concept

- You can install source packages from a public links / local system  (or internal links if you wish)
- All source codes are stored in the state in which you installed (you can commit them and modify)
- Compliance with licenses on your conscience
